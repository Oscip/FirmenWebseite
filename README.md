# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
## Quick Start

Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install dependencies, then start the app and mock API.

## Starter Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I made the following enhancements:

1. Added a mock API using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Configured `npm start` to run the app and mock API at the same time using [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all). See [Building Applications with React and Flux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-flux-building-applications/table-of-contents) for details on how to set this up from scratch.
1. Installed [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom), [history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history) (React Router peer dependency), and [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=cross-env) for declaring environment variables.
1. Added some React components to help us get started: Header, Footer, Spinner
1. Added styles to App.css
1. Added `/public/images`.
1. Added data fetching functions in `/src/services`.
1. Added db.json to root as json-server's mock database
1. Overwrote App.css with custom styles
1. Simplified index.js (removed service worker)
1. Deleted from src: index.css, logo.svg, serviceWorker.js, App.test.js
1. Deleted from public: logo files, manifest.json, robots.txt
1. Customized App.js and renamed to App.jsx
